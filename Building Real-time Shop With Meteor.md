# Building Real-time Shop With Meteor

## Why Meteor?
Easy to learn because you’ll learn less. You just need to learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS. No need to learn Ruby, Python, PHP, etc.

## What is Meteor?

It’s not only framework, it’s a platform. Meteor have their own package manager called atmosphere. At the client side, Meteor has it’s own template engine called blaze. At the server side, it’s NodeJS. It’s fullstack JavaScript platform, perfect for building real-time web apps. It’s reactive and the database available everywhere.

Meteor uses JavaScript on both client and server side. And also able to share between them. Thanks to NodeJS.

### Overview of the Code

Now let’s see the code generated by Meteor.

First we look at the body. There is `{{> hello}}` that will load template called `hello` at the bottom. `hello` template by any chance could be in another file and Meteor still recognise it. 

`{{greeting}}` is variable that bind from javascipt file.
